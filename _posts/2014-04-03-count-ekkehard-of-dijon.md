<p class="lead">Having placed my fate in the hands of the gods, I awoke on the first of January 867 with absolutely no knowledge of who I was. I hadn't necessarily had too much to drink the previous evening, although equally I very well may have: at this stage, I knew nothing about myself. Fortunately, I quickly located a portrait of myself and read from its frame that I was Count Ekkehard of Dijon, of House Karling.</p>
<hr />

### 1st January, 867
I am Ekkehard Karling, Count of Dijon and also of Charolais. I am 65 years old, unmarried, and my only living relative is my younger half-brother. I am a skilled tactician; I am proud, envious and zealous. And I am a glutton. But, more than that, I am going to get married! I've made it my ambition, so I won't be resting easy until it's done. I could definitely do with a child, so my wife will need to be a little younger than I am.

Inspecting my family tree, I notice that my great, great grandfather was the youngest of four brothers. One of his elder brothers had a son who went on to be king, and from him kings have rather run in the family. Right now, his line accounts for the kings of East Francia, West Francia, Aquitaine and Bavaria. The junior line of the family &mdash; *my* line of the family &mdash; has only ever accounted for Counts of Vexin, Dijon and Charolais. It is my glorious and noble dream to see this line of the family continue to limp along in the shadow of the kingly one; ambition is fine and dandy but there's a lot to be said for being happy with one's lot, and thus continuing to have a lot to be happy with.

### 2nd January
King Charles the Bald (I'm reasonably sure everyone calls him that and this isn't some sort of practical joke someone's playing to trick me into getting myself beheaded...) has granted me the Duchy of Burgundy. Right! Forget what I said yesterday: I'm taking over Europe and getting revenge on my privileged cousins on the way!

### 3rd January
Just noticed that this Duchy doesn't actually come with any more land than I already had; world domination plans placed back on hold (or, more accurately, never quite started).
