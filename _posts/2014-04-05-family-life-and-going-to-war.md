### 4th January, 867
Wasting no time, I have identified an excellent prospective wife in Princess Ermentrude of West Francia: a fellow Karling, and daughter to my king. Perfect. And she is, as desired, my junior: 48. 48 years my junior, that is. She's 17.

### 8th January
Ermentrude and I are married! I waived the taxes and paid for the wedding myself. I'm an old man and I'm quite happy dying popular with an impoverished heir.

### 1st February
<strong>WAR!</strong><br />
We've declared war against somewhere far away. There are an awful lot of armies on the move, but I think I'll sit this one out.

### 12th March, 868
My hunch was bang on the money: they won just fine without me.

### 30th March, 871
<strong>WAR!</strong><br />
A civil war has broken out, with the rebels seeking elective monarchy. I'd definitely go and do my bit, but it looks a little dangerous out there.

### 20th November
I have a daughter: Melissa!

### 16th February, 874
After a suitable period of observation, I raised my armies and entered the war in April 872 when it was clear that the king had a decent advantage. In June of that year, my forces joined battle for the first time: 655 men wisely choosing to make their debut by entering a battle that was already one-sided to the tune of 3500 men vs 1000. We went on to fight our own battles and chase down the fleeing rebel armies, and today the war was won.

In August last year, I suggested to King Adelchis of Italy that he marry my young daughter. Well, I suggested it to his regent, the king being only two years old himself. Not only did he agree to the idea, he also agreed that the betrothal be matrilineal, meaning that any children will be Melissa's line rather than the king's. I wasn't entirely certain what he was thinking, but nor was I keen to ask too many questions and inadvertently bring him to his senses.

### 30th June, 877
<strong>WAR</strong> broke out again in May 876, with the king claiming a county from Lotharingia. As the county directly borders my own, I boldly raised my levies and went straight out and laid siege to the place. Over the past year, we have fought some significant battles and successfully sieged Chalon (which we'd had to leave for a while for said battles). I have decided that I've got really quite good at this war lark (apparently I'm now a 'brilliant strategist'), so I've made it my ambition to become Marshall of West Francia. I think I'm in with a pretty good shot, although I guess it rather depends how the king sees West Francia using my brilliant strategy of hiding until the outcome is assured.
